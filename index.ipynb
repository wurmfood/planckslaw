    "Every object that has a temperature gives off light. The light given off depends on the temperature of the object. Think of a piece of iron that is heated up. Initially, at room temperature, it doesn't look like it's giving off any light. With the right tools, though, you can see that it's giving off infrared light. As you heat it up, however, the iron will start to glow a dull red and then move more toward a white color. Really, everything does this, we just don't have a way to see it with our eyes alone.\n",

The x-axis shows the different wavelengths (visible light areas are approximated on the graph based on common descriptions of color ranges) of light given off. The y-axis shows how much light (well, energy, technically) is given off at those wavelengths. Notice that the scale for the y-axis changes. This is because there's a huge difference in the amount of light given off by a cooler object compared to one that is much hotter. If we used one scale for all of them it would make it very difficult to see.\n",
